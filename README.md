# PMSM-Inverter-Design-PCB
<p>Documenting the progress of an attempt to design an inverter for a permanent magnet synchronous motor (three-phase).<br>
记录尝试设计永磁同步电机（三相）的逆变器的进展，希望能成功！</p>

## The softwares used during design are Altium Designer, Code Composer Studio.
<p>Altium Designer is very helpful for drawing circuit diagrams. It could be got from https://www.altium.com/altium-designer.<br>
Code Composer Studio is a software development tool for DSP. It could be got from https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO.</p>
