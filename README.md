# PMSM-Inverter-Design-PCB 
<p>Documenting the progress of an attempt to design an inverter for a permanent magnet synchronous motor (three-phase).<br>
记录尝试设计永磁同步电机（三相）的逆变器的进展，希望能成功！（写的很乱，中英混杂，最后再整理吧）</p>

# Content 目录
## 1.前期背景知识储备
## 2.使用的软件
## 3.逆变器控制部分
## 4.原理图绘制

## The softwares used during design are Altium Designer, Code Composer Studio.
<p>Altium Designer is very helpful for drawing circuit diagrams. It could be got from https://www.altium.com/altium-designer.<br>
Code Composer Studio is a software development tool for DSP. It could be got from https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO.</p>
